    Mushrooms are all over the place! It just takes some time to develop an eye for them. The more you practice,
    the more you learn to slow down and really notice things. Mushrooms are especially fond of appearing after the rain.
    They also like certain temperatures (different mushrooms thrive in different environments). The best way to start
    is to simply go outside, walk slowly, and pay attention to the ground ahead of and around you. Going into the woods
    is best! Searching near trees and bushes is good too. Mushrooms also like compost and dead growth, so looking
    around fallen trees is good too.Pretty soon you'll be noticing other members of the forest, and soon enough you'll
    come across some mushrooms.
